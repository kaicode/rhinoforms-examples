<h3>Validation Attribute Example</h3>
<p>Here we use the validation attribute on text fields.</p>
<p>Validation is performed first in the browser and again on the server using the same javascript code.</p>
<p>The validation keywords 'required' and 'email' are is used.</p>
<p>These are built-in keywords. Your own can be added using the rf.registerValidationKeyword method.</p>
